FOR V2.0
Test! (20A continuous, step response, reverse & overvoltage protection, input/output shorts)
move P1 away from GND1 hole
add thermal relief on C1, C2, R1, R4 etc
silkscreen on /SHDN header P1 describing
move FETs upwards & centre IN/OUT holes to FETs
make for M4 bolts (incl bigger pads), leave enough clearance for ring crimp terminals
move bottom half compoents slightly to left to give even space
make whole PCB taller - square? to give better thermal, lower resistance etc
dont need 1M pullup resistor!
be very careful when soldering, must have damaged LTC4359 before! Solder Q1 Q2 first.
LTC4359I only 85C (125C for H version), cut plane back slightly & move FETS upwards to stop heating up? Consider H version.
silkscreen to show big diode for main function - bottom? also for big +ve and -ve signs
possibly use larger R1 value, but smaller case size. Sacrifices some of the minimum voltage to reduce power in component during reverse protection fault
option to BOM fit change to BSC016N06NSATMA1 fets for 1.5mohm instead of 2.5mohm Rdson
Change from 60V protection to 70V to allow higher input voltage?
remove second ground hole and just have single? removes dissipation in  GND tracks & two ring terminals could be attached on one hole
Fix Q1 Q2 D3 missing 3D models
Find another way of doing thermal vias instead of current bodge that results in annoying text all over pcb view
find out why silkscreen refdes dont look visible in Kicad (appear OK in gerbers)
